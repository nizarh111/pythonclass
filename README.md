## Who will be crowned Coding Champion?
The aim of this contest is to decode the secret message inside the file "secret.txt". <br>
The first person to decode the message wins a special prize.*<br>
The file is encoded in such a way that each line represents one letter. The number of vowels in each line represents the letter index in the alphabet: "space" - 0 vowels, "a" - 1 vowel, "b" - 2 vowels, ..., "z" = 26 vowels.<br>
Clone this repo and start coding in "decode_start.py". You have some starting variables already defined.<br>
